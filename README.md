# Robotic-Finger-Gesture-Emulation
#### Simulation of A Smart Real-Time Gesture Emulation Controlled Finger-Robot using Image Processing in SolidWorks and MATALB.

In this project, a **robotic finger** is built which tracks the motion of a human finger. Despite its simplicity, the project consists of distinct items relating to diferent fields of mechatronics that all come together in harmony to result in the real-time motion tracking of the robotic finger. **3D-printing** of the designed parts in **SOLIDWORKS**, applying robot vision using mediapipe library in **python**, followed by coding **Arduino** and building the ultimate circuit by attaching the Arduino to the servo motor, are the major tasks to implement to build the proposed robot.

The function of the robot was first tested in **MATLAB SimMechanics** environment, before having the real robot actually taken action; and the final experiments on the robotic finger were done due to the suitable results of the simulation responding to the commands of the python code that was responsible for resolving the state of a human index finger, changing position in front of a computer webcam. It is worth to mention that the simulation part was not implemented in real-time, but the the orders were stored in an excel file and later inserted in Simulink environment.

The aim of the whole this efforts is to build a tracking robotic finger with the minimum cost and complexity but able of all the bending expected from a human finger to be used in more complex robots that are supposed to grab and pick stuff.

*key words: robotic finger, real-time motion tracking, robot vision, servo motor, 3D-printing, Arduino coding.*
